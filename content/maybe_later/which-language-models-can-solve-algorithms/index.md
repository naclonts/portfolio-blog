On The Algorithm Design Manual problem 2-53, I got this solution as did o1-preview:

\[
\text{Total Ways} = \prod_{k=2}^{n} \binom{k}{2} = \prod_{k=2}^{n} \frac{k(k - 1)}{2}
\]

ChatGPT 4o-mini thought the solution was the Catalan number for n - 1, based on the number of ways to merge leaves in a binary tree.

Question:

> "Suppose we start with n companies that eventually merge into one big company. How many different ways are there for them to merge?"

o1-mini gave this answer!

> Number of ways=(2n−3)!!=(2n−3)×(2n−5)×⋯×3×1

A double factorial!!

ChatGPT 4 failed on The Algorithm Design Manual problem 2-49, while o1-mini nailed it.

! 4 succeeded on a re-run!

Problem:

> 2-49. We have 1,000 data items to store on 1,000 nodes. Each node can store copies of exactly three different items. Propose a replication scheme to minimize data loss as nodes fail. What is the expected number of data entries that get lost when three random nodes fail?
