If I am lucky\
I will have the chance\
To strain\
With all my spirit,\
All my body,\
All my mind,\
And all my soul\
Against the great machine that will not move.\
\
If I am lucky enough\
To be flayed,\
Flames licking the skin,\
Arrows cutting the skin,\
Rough stone bruising the shoulder,\
To pull that stone on up that steep old hill?\
\
If I am lucky enough\
To raise,\
After sweating,\
Bleeding, bruising,\
Cursing, despairing,\
To raise that stone up high:\
Happy I will be when I go die.

\
Here's to Difficult things,\
Not to easy things,\
Not to Things done without thought,\
Not done without Intuition.\
\
Here is to the Hero,\
She who swims under the great blue ocean,\
Who casts her offspring to the stars\
For them to live and die and meet their fate.\
\
For these are things that can never be forgotten,\
Even when man is gone,\
When earth is gone,\
When time is gone:\
The Difficult Things that were done can never be erased.
